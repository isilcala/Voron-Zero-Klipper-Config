max_z_velocity: 15
max_z_accel: 45
#minimum_cruise_ratio: 0.5
#   Most moves will accelerate to a cruising speed, travel at that
#   cruising speed, and then decelerate. However, some moves that
#   travel a short distance could nominally accelerate and then
#   immediately decelerate. This option reduces the top speed of these
#   moves to ensure there is always a minimum distance traveled at a
#   cruising speed. That is, it enforces a minimum distance traveled
#   at cruising speed relative to the total distance traveled. It is
#   intended to reduce the top speed of short zigzag moves (and thus
#   reduce printer vibration from these moves). For example, a
#   minimum_cruise_ratio of 0.5 would ensure that a standalone 1.5mm
#   move would have a minimum cruising distance of 0.75mm. Specify a
#   ratio of 0.0 to disable this feature (there would be no minimum
#   cruising distance enforced between acceleration and deceleration).
#   The value specified here may be changed at runtime using the
#   SET_VELOCITY_LIMIT command. The default is 0.5.
square_corner_velocity: 6.0
#   The maximum velocity (in mm/s) that the toolhead may travel a 90
#   degree corner at. A non-zero value can reduce changes in extruder
#   flow rates by enabling instantaneous velocity changes of the
#   toolhead during cornering. This value configures the internal
#   centripetal velocity cornering algorithm; corners with angles
#   larger than 90 degrees will have a higher cornering velocity while
#   corners with angles less than 90 degrees will have a lower
#   cornering velocity. If this is set to zero then the toolhead will
#   decelerate to zero at each corner. The value specified here may be
#   changed at runtime using the SET_VELOCITY_LIMIT command. The
#   default is 5mm/s.

[gcode_arcs]
resolution: 0.1 #1.0
#   An arc will be split into segments. Each segment's length will
#   equal the resolution in mm set above. Lower values will produce a
#   finer arc, but also more work for your machine. Arcs smaller than
#   the configured value will become straight lines. The default is
#   1mm.
